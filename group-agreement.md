# Group Agreement

## Conflict Resolution
    When conflicts occur, we will first talk to come to an agreement. If conflict does not resolute after discussion, we will ask a teaching assistant/instructor to help come to the conclusion. 




## Communication Plan

Slack will be used for internal communication and Trello will be used for resource collection. 

People can volunteer and make available after hours by either text or slack. 

It is the responsibility of each member to voice their potential road blocks to their peers so it can be resolved.
